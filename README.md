# COVID19_hackers
The goal of the project is to identify the critical states that affected by COVID-19 and need more attention regarding vaccination . The project will consider multiple aspects of vulnerability such as population, COVID-19 cases, ability to afford treatment, health infrastructure availability, demographics etc. This will help the administrators to rightly make arrangements for vaccinating and thus curb the spread of COVID-19.  Also, we will get an insight into which state is more affected, identify the spread of the disease and administer immediate planning of vaccination . A similar study can be extended to country, zone and ward wise analysis for effective planning of administering the vaccination.

Priority index = function (fraction of population not vaccinated,number of people per bed, human development index and covid cases)
Equal weightage to all the factors as the fractions are normalized to 1.
#
#
The code automatically takes the latest information on number of covid cases and vaccines administered whenever it is run.
#
#
Just update the root_dir path in the code.
#
#
Further scope: The index can be extended to district/zone/ward wise to understand the priority in which they have to be vaccinated. The code can be automated to mail the pie chart daily to the health care officials and administrators.
